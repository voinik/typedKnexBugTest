To get it to work you'll need a postgres database and a .env file containing: `PG_USER`, `PG_PASS` and `PG_DBNAME`.

Then:
1. run `npm install`
2. run `npm run create-database`
3. run `npm start`

Check the outputs. 


As explained in the comments in `test.ts`, a portion of the first `console.log` output that I get is:
`organization: { accessUntilExtend: false }`

The second `console.log` that I get is:
`organizationDb:  { accessUntilExtended: false }`

Notice how the property name of `accessUntilExtended` is misspelled in the first log. I'm not sure what is happening here...

I did the same query using just regular Knex:
`node test.js`
Wich results in the same:
{ 'paymentProviderCustomerReference.organization.accessUntilExtend': false }


Edit: I've found the culprit. It's not TypedKnex, it's postgres:

> NOTICE:  identifier "paymentProviderCustomerReference.organization.accessUntilExtended" will be truncated to "paymentProviderCustomerReference.organization.accessUntilExtend"

The same thing happens in Knex.

Do you think you want to fix this problem within TypedKnex, or will you leave it up to the devs to be aware of this postgres behavior?
